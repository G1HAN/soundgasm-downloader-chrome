# Soundgasm Downloader

Download audio files from [**soundgasm.net**](https://soundgasm.net/).

- Adds a Download button on audio pages
- Adds a Download all button on author pages

I modified [Firefox add-on](https://github.com/deathbydeprecation/soundgasm-downloader) to Chrome extension.

I've never used JavaScript, so I copied the stack overflow code.

I don't know how to run the script after waiting for the page to load completely, so the tab opens and the script runs 100ms later.

Since it simply operates through a timer, a problem may occur depending on a network situation.

If anyone knows a better code, please correct it.
